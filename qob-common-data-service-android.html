                            <p> I am looking for jobs/internships and most of them have the requirement of REST API. I have also heard this thing associated with Retrofit. Should I learn Retrofit or something. 
I've had this problem off and on over the last few years, and I can't for the life of me figure out what's causing it. I own a Sony Xperia Z3 Compact Tablet, and have had it for a little over two years with numerous factory resets between then and now. Currently, I'm running stock 6.0.1 android (build 23.5.A.1.291). The issue I'm having is, at random times throughout the day, my tablet thinks it's somewhere in Pennsylvania (weatherunderground thinks Cereal, PA while Google Now thinks Disclaimer: This only relates to Android systems. In the latest among a series of controversies, we now have Blizzard forcing us to use an app in order to access our tickets. This controversy, however, has a distinct and foul stink of misinformation surrounding it. I saw a mod say that it's important to understand what you're giving an application access to. I agree, so I'm here to do just that. I'm also here to tell you what you're not giving it access to. It's fine to be worried about. #Hearthstone Beginners Guide (Year of the Dragon) ####Note: Old Adventures (Kobolds and Catacombs and Knights of the Frozen Throne) can be purchased for free in the Blizzard store with the next patch in mid-May - - - If this is a bit overwhelming, or you just want a general direction, you want to beat all the AI on each difficulty, get all classes to Level 10, one class to Level 20, and complete your daily quests and weekly Tavern Brawls. --- 1.

Last week, while on an extended trip to California (I live in NY), I received a text from my former landlord stating that she could no longer keep in touch with me because I violated her house rules and beliefs by having an abortion (which did not happen), lying to her about it, and setting a bad example for her teenaged daughter, who's like a younger sister to me. I am very close to her ‚Äì‚Äì she's like the mother I never had ‚Äì‚Äì I spend weekends with her and tell her everything. The text containe. First of all, absolutely do not get overwhelmed by what I'm about to share. This is everything I've found or created myself or heard of from others and collected over 3-5 years (pre-nursing + nursing school). You don't necessarily need all of this to thrive in nursing school. Pick and choose what works for you. This is very long I know, but hopefully very worth your reading. A friend told me I had to write this up and post it, so here I am. A little context about me and my background: Figures they would drop a huge update while I was away, but here goes! Based on feedback I'll try to create clearer headings to make it easier to skim. This is the first time I've done a teardown that housed such a massive upcoming feature, so I've tried to trim down the extra bits as much as I could, while still delivering all the information I found, but spoiler, it's several truck loads this time. Anyway, let's get started! # New Filters This is already known. 
Tl; dr: By replacing the computer-advised, hyper-analytical Section 31 leadership with a rogue AI, they've replaced a complicated story about ends and means, the national security state, and the modern data driven world, with one more evil robot. In some ways, 'Project Daedalus' was Discovery's most put together episode of the season, or perhaps the entire run. The show as a whole was suffering from the 'serial syndrome' of thinking that characterization was a consequence of the total hours. Hello Everyone! I have been a long time investor in Mutual Funds and have tried multiple Portfolio Managers. One thing which I hated was keeping the portfolio up-to-date - there was just too much effort involved in creating and maintaining my portfolio. To address that problem, I created an Android app for myself which imports my portfolio automatically - no manual entry required! A friend asked me to share the app with him few months back and I decided to put it on the Play Store (which I used to work for a cell phone company back in the bad old days before iPhones and Android, when Blackberry ruled the land, and you had limited minutes and texts. At the time, customers with Palm or Blackberry devices got unlimited data for  per month on top of whatever calling and texting plan they had. One day, there was a massive DOS attack on Blackberry's servers, and since Blackberry's OS was set up to run everything through their servers, that meant that all BB users The Wine development release 4.4 is now available. https://www.winehq.org/announce/4.4 What's new in this release (see below for details): - New MSIDB tool for manipulating MSI databases. - Support for custom draw buttons in common controls. - Many more Media Foundation APIs implemented. - Various bug fixes.

So you've decided to head across the Pond to London for the two game series at the end of June. You're an absolute legend, following your team across an ocean, and we should have a suitcase statue in Monument Park for dedicated people like your good self. The only problem is, you don't know what you're going to do with yourself. Maybe you already have a game ticket, maybe you're hoping to snag one outside the stadium in the Stratford area of London, maybe. I thought it would be helpful to make a single post aggregating all the common complaints people have with the 9.0 Pie update and how to fix them. This guide is aimed to be new-user friendly.

Welcome to my guide for everything that paid me in 2018. Before I begin, here are a few details: I do this completely on the side as a hobby. I have a job and am in school full time. This is just ‚Äúextra‚Äù. I don‚Äôt really do passive video programs and I don‚Äôt have a phone farm. Also, no mTurk. I did not include referral earnings, and all of my earnings I included here are earned within the sites‚Äô TOS and without exploiting. Someone in r/iphone asked to show why someone would like ios more than android. I wrote so much i didnt want to waste it, so here is the full comment. Would like continued discussion from my r/apple folks. üôÇ Let‚Äôs see. both operating systems have their perks, and as long as you are not an idiot you can do most of the same things without issue. However, for the casual user, android is much more dangerous. Malware and spyware frequent the google play store. Emails, messages, and ads online. 
When I've an idle moment or two in my Model 3 LR AWD (mostly when waiting to pick up my kids from various events) I muse on how the car ought evolve. It seems some advise sending requests to ServiceHelpNA@tesla.com (mailto:ServiceHelpNA@tesla.com) so I've just done that. But knowing how addresses of that sort tend to work, I'd thought I'd post here to socialize the list further. Ideally, Tesla would offer feature request voting in their own forums (dropbox for example did this really. First of all, absolutely do not get overwhelmed by what I'm about to share.

This is very long but very worth the read I think. NOTE: This post was originally written by me FOR those already in nursing school. Figured it would be helpful here too but be aware you should focus on the basics (e.g. mastering. I wrote the post below for nursing students and it was very well-received over in r/StudentNurse (https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentNurse/comments/b3otty/bsn_nursing_student_in_icu_and_soontobe_rn_here). I know tons of nursing students or pre-nursing students lurk here in this sub or ask questions about these things below and might not be aware of r/StudentNurse or r/prenursing, so I thought it might be worthwhile to share here as well.
