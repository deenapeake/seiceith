you can also upgrade it to studio one 4 for when your ready. (cheaper than buying studio one 4 in this case). I'm looking at staying at the 0 to 00 USD price point. This would be my first PC after having a Mac for 10 years, so I'm very much a noob about all of this. I'm currently doing audio editing with Presonus Studio One Professional and video with iMovie. I've done a little research and came up with this. https://pcpartpicker.com/list/nPskGf Maybe you guys have some opinions on this list? Posting from Tulsa, Oklahoma To answer the original question, it probably does not considering the fact I'm using a guitar in Drop D. The Safety Fire's song Huge Hammers, Periphery's song Mile Zero, and even OMNOM's (Of Man Not Of Machine) Snow Angel largely influenced me in constructing this song back in August. I know it's not perfect but I'm a closet poor college student DIY musician where most people at my college couldn't give two shits about djent (more or less even know what djent is). Tell me what you think. I have a (hopefully) quick question about phase issues. First off, is this actually an issue when working totally in the box? Most of my projects are VSTs and samples (although I do ocassionally record vocals or guitar/synth through an amp). Or is it only important when you have multiple mic'ed elements? Does anyone have experience with having phase problems between, say, two different synthesizers? Or is this really an issue that you see mainly in projects where you have (for instance) three. 
What will you be doing with this PC? Making music. At the moment, I'm using Reaper on my Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro and it lags a lot. I've tried freezing tracks and other suggestions read online and nothing's working. I don't think I have that many tracks or use that many VSTs, but maybe the VSTs I use are pretty memory intensive. I don't use samples other than virtual drums that play off midi. Other than that, I record guitar and bass through a PreSonus AudioBox Hello! I've noticed more and more posts coming from beginners asking questions along the lines of "how do I get into producing", so I decided to write this guide. This is going to be slightly opinionated based on my experiences  If you don't agree with something I say, please let me know and we can discuss! The point of this guide is to be as useful as possible to newcomers. DISCLAIMER: Before I get started, I just want to say that I am by no means a professional at this. I have about. # Audio Mastering 101: Guide to Improving Your Audio on stream! Just a quick introduction; I'm Mr.Goodhand. Today marks the first day I seriously am considering transitioning to Mixer from Twitch. I started streaming awhile back, on twitch, but found its severe level of over saturation to be.a bit.over the top these days. I made several guides on the twitch sub-reddit involving audio, and I wanted to share them with the mixer community. Utilization of these audio techniques is purely. The ultimate guide to posting and overall time-saver. Check all the topics and find the one that applies to you. ## ATTENTION: Posts made by accounts less than 60 days old and/or with less than 30 COMMENT karma, will be automatically deleted .

After a month of this post being up we still receive about five daily submissions which get filtered and the vast majority are due to comment karma. This is for a number of reasons: 
I've been working on a wiki in my spare time that provides a basic resource for beginning songwriters to understand some of what I consider to be the important aspects of songwriting and being a songwriter. The wiki has a hard cap on character limits that I'm exceeding by a huge margin, so I'll split them into posts and link to each thread in the wiki itself. amp#x200B; # I. Recording a. Demos 1. You have a microphone right in your pocket! I’ve used my phone to record low-quality demos. Bitwig was a big promise which took my early on board. I subscribed as soon as it was possible and I purchased one of the first boxed copies of the software as soon as it was available. Between the first beta announcement and the release of the so called version 1 were 2 years passed - a long time. Especially if you remember when the development on Bitwig started (around 2009) - so it took the developers nearly 5 years to develop a first release - and it was a big and fat disappointment. I'll preface this by saying I am an absolute beginner; I am trying to understand the very basics of how music works, and I'd like to start making music as a hobby. I was thinking about getting Presonus Studio One as my first DAW, it's on sale right now. However I don't understand the difference between versions of DAW software. It's a bit overwhelming so I have a few questions: - What are the limitations of certain versions of DAW software, such as Artist vs Professional (In the case of Studi. If you were thinking about buying it nows the time. They also have the upgrades available as well. I just paid 149$ for Artist to Professional upgrade. amp#x200B; https://shop.presonus.com/Studio-One-4-Professional (https://shop.presonus.com/Studio-One-4-Professional). Hello. I've made a very detailed featured requests on the missing basic professional audio features that Studio One is lacking, the features that separate the bedroom producers from high achievers in the industry. After talking with graduates and some of my professors at Berklee College of Music, I've found that Studio One kind of has a stigma in the higher levels of production currently because of these missing features. I truly love Studio One's workflow layout, but it is impossi. </p>
