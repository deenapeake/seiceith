                            <p>Hi r/printers. I have already written to HP for my problem, but didn't get any response and I can't find any definitive help online, so here I am. I own an "XPRESS M2070FW - JC63-04269C". It is connected to my home network via Ethernet cable. It receives its IP via DHCP protocol. I run MS Windows 10 Pro x64 on a Lenovo Ideapad Y700 (laptop). I am currently using a non-OEM toner cartridge. I have installed on the laptop in question the following software: - Universal Scan Driver for Windows. Hi all! I'm extremely stumped on this one and haven't been able to find very much on the web relating to anything like this so I'd very much appreciate any advice anyone could give me! : ) I woke up yesterday morning to find that my main desktop computer on my network suddenly is not able to visit websites after a very short amount of time after booting up and connecting. To elaborate: I start up my computer, log in, see the internet tray icon showing a connection to the internet Hi everyone, i'll try and keep everything as short as possible. I recently built a new computer, had been playing games like Overwatch, Fortnite and CS:GO without any sort of issue. PC Specs: \- Mobo: ASUS Rog Strix z370\-e Gaming \- CPU: Intel Core i5\-8600k \(not OC'ed yet\) \- RAM: Corsair Vengeance RGB 2x8gb 3000mhz \(as i'm checking this I see the RAM is registered as "16.0GB Dual\-Channel Unkown @1069Mhz \(15\-15\-15\-36\)" in Speccy\) \- GPU: Asus Rog Strix GTX 1080ti 11gb Gamin. 
# MAME 0.186 ( It’s been one of those long, five-week development cycles, but it’s finally time for your monthly MAME fix. There’s been a lot of touched in this release, with improvements in a number of areas. But before we get to the improvements, we have an embarrassing admission to make: the game added in 0.185 as Acchi Muite Hoi is actually Pata Pata Panic, and the sound ROM mapping was incorrect, making the game unplayable. That’s all sorted out now though I'm in the market for a networked color laser MFP with an automatic dual-sided document feeder, from any of the major brands. Also must be able to scan to email (which should be a given nowadays) Features such as wifi, NFC, Airprint, scan/print to/from USB etc are not interesting if it adds to the cost. Looking to print 10 pages/day so cost per page is a minor factor. I'd like a lightweight driver with no bloatware. Preferably one where the producer has a universal driver. Also, no Samsung. I just recent did a fresh reinstall of windows 7 and now I'm running into this annoying error. It shows the drivers in the device manager ( universal serial bus (USB) controller) but its not installed nor does it install. When I right click it in the device manager and choose scan for hardware changes it just says "device driver software was not succefully installed". In unable to connect to the internet and unable to install any drivers due to me not having a usb drive that wants to download. I have a bit of a strange issue with my desktop computer. When I try to turn my computer on and I can hear the fans power up but I don't get the POST beep unless I leave it to sit and basically warm up for about 20 minutes. Eventually it'll beep and start properly. If I cycle the power a bunch of times it might turn on properly a bit sooner but I can't be certain that it's making a difference. Once the comp is turned on, everything is working fine and I have no issues. If I reboot the computer. 
I bought my computer 4(?) years ago. It could run any program on its highest spec, and I loved it. Over time it's become slower and slower, and all my attempts have failed to fix it. I've uninstalled things, used disk cleanup, used disk defragmenter, updated drivers. I'm sure these attempts to get a faster computer seem stupid to all you here, but I've tried! Is it just a case of programs requiring more "stuff", so I need new "stuff"? Below is my dxdiag report, which SPECS (omitting stuff like the case and other irrelevant things): OS: Windows 7 SP1 SSD: SanDisk Extreme 240 GB Mechanical HD: Samsung EcoGreen F4 2TB Mobo: Biostar TZ77XE3 CPU: Intel Core i5 3570K Graphics card: EVGA Nvidia GTX 680 RAM: 16 GB Corsair Vengeance Cooler: Corsair H100 PSU: Corsair AX 750 I'm not trying to be unrealistic - I do understand that as you put more stuff on a machine, it will have to do more tasks in the same amount of time. This being said, I'm starting Hi everyone, I recently just bough a "AOC G2460FQ" monitor that's supposed to work with 144hz. When I first got the screen I got the manual, downloaded the drivers as instructed and restarted the system. Also, I got DVI-D and Display Port cables in the package. I can turn on 100/120/144hz in both resolution settings and NVIDIA control panel. Though I can sense that it's not even as smooth as my last 60hz monitor, it feels like it's flickering and every time something moves over a dark shafe. 
Hi! I don't think it's necessary for this particular problem, but let's start with the specs: ------------------ System Information ------------------ Time of this report: 1/5/2015, 16:24:25 Machine name: Operating System: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit (6.1, Build 7601) Service Pack 1 (7601.win7sp1_ldr.140706-1507) Language: Norwegian (Bokmål) (Regional Setting: Norwegian (Bokmål)) System Manufacturer: System manufacturer System Model: System Product. My CD ROM doesn't work so I couldn't try out the drivers that came with the printer, but I'm guessing (as usually things go) that it contains the same drivers that I can download from Samsung's website. Anyway, the printer works great, but it's a pain in the ass to set it up to work over network. First of all, I've connected the printer to my router and set its IP address on its keypad (for some reason Windows wouldn't detect it if I set it to have a DHCP address, so I entered a static EDIT: SORRY I AM TERRIBLE AT REDDIT FORMATTING. I tried to do a spoiler but to no avail. I guess theres a wall of system info text. Now details! Cat peed inside my computer.yes that's right. We tested each component and only the graphics card got fried, so I ordered a new one. It arrived and a friend of mine installs it for me, and re-formats my hard drives (it was about that time anyways). So he updates everything including the video drivers. I get my PC back from him, everything </p>
